    <h1>THE GLOBETROTTERS</h1>

    <h2>JON BON JOVI</h2>

    <p> When it comes to entertainment at sea, oceangoers may be more familiar with a certain type of tuxedoÂ­clad
      crooner inspired by Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett. But if any cruise line was going to invite the
      stadium-filling New Jersey-born singer behind Slippery When Wet dn board, it was Norwegian. The line has
      graffiti-style murals, rock-climbing walls, and no dress codes on its ships, preferring to encourage
      informal, freestyle gatherings. The Bon Jovi frontman will be headlining the Runaway to Paradise voyage,
      from Barcelona to Palma, Mallorca, on the Norwegian Pearl in August, performing a full-blown concert
      backed by an 11-piece band on the pool deck. There's also an acoustic set, during which he'll take
      questions from the audience, accompanied by longtime tour photographer David Bergman and producer Obie
      O'Brien.As for his dress code, that's easy:The singer has worn the same Reebok Allen Iverson sneakers
      onstage for the past 15 years. </p>

      <h2>PATRICIA URQUIOLA</h2>

        <p> Over the past two decades, the prolific Spanish-born designer and architect has quietly become one of the most
successful names in her field. Her ergonomic creations are playful yet have real substance, often experimenting
with color and contours. You may have tip-toed across her geometric ceramic tiles, dropped into the Scandi-inspired
Lilo Lounge chairs she made for Moroso, or admired her floaty, snow-white cutouts at Mandarin Oriental Barcelona.
Urquiola's Fjord armchair is part of the permanent collection at MoMA, and the hotel 11 Sereno, whose interiors
she designed, was the most anticipated opening on the shores of Lake Como in years. So it was a coup when Celebrity
Cruises persuaded her to add her name to the design roll call for its pioneering Celebrity Edge ship. The
line has always had fun with its cruises, going the extra mile in the way its staff interact with passengers
and deftly upscaling the small-boat experience. The billion-dollar Edge is a game changer that aims to disrupt
dusty preconceptions about cruising-there are immersive theater shows, botanical-inspired cocktails, a drone
obstacle course, and the open-air Magic Carpet platform, which scoots up and down decks outside the hull. As
for Urquiola's contributions, well, she has given Mediterranean restaurant Cyprus a hot-summer ambience and
planted a towering installation of foliage above the bar at Eden, a hybrid space that mutates from daytime
hangout to nocturnal performance venue. It's everything you never thought you'd see on a cruise ship._ And
that is exactly the point. </p>
